Crystal is a two prong blockchain with an additional monetary chain to incentivize support through use. Crystal is entirely open source and those who host nodes can select which part of the eco-system is installed.

Currently, Crystal does not have build tools and only has the TransactionChain mostly programmed. The CitationChain and the FeedbackChain will be available as well and Crystal will be buildable via CLI after downloading the source.

Crystal is a solution to address misinformation. We built it in response to social media platforms not doing enough to police content. More recently, Twitter has released Birdwatch to help curb curb their problem. While their solution may be more effecient Crystal aims to be decentralized so that any platform can benefit off of the technology, creating a smaller barrier to entry for innovators to create social media alternatives that foster more inclusive and safe environments.
