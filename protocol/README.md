# Protocol
The GEM protocol is broken into two key separate components:
- Citation Component
- Feedback Component

## Citation Component
The citation component is what allows users to share valuable information about sources and creative works that gives others the ability to quickly determine if the linked source is legitimate or if it should be challenged.

## Feedback Component
The feedback component is what allows users to determine information that is published is accurate based on a subprotocol designed to meet different grading criteria.

## Purpose
The purpose of splitting up these two components is to give node managers the ability to choose what components to host as a citation component is not always essential, especially considering the size that the node may grow to along with hosting costs.
